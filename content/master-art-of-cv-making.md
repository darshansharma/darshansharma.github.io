Create your resume to show your skills, experience and talent. Additionally, it's essential to infuse your CV with a distinctive factor that sets you apart. Here are some tips to enhance your resume:

## One Page Resume
Unless you possess over a decade of experience or are embedded in the academic sphere, your CV should be confined to a single page. Those who claim this is merely a myth are mistaken, particularly in the fields of Information Technology or Computer Science. Assume, I am a recruiter at some company **example.com** and I recieve 10,000 resume for full-stack development roles on daily basis - How much time do you think I am going to spend on your resume?  
  
The response is **zero** seconds. At this level you are not only competing with those other 5000 CVs (~4999 people send even without reading job description - so they are automatically out). Now your competition is reduced by 50%.

Still, you need to compete with other 5k and to make your resume stand out if it spans multiple pages - it would be difficult for your CV to parse ATS.

## Why ATS? 
A recruiter cannot go through 5000 CVs a day so every major company use ATS to filter out resumes which are sent by candidates -  
1. Without reading job description  
2. Without having required experience  
3. Resume spanning multiple pages  
4. Resume which are poorly formatted  
  
  
Focus on yourself and your skills, heck even start using AI like ChatGPT or Claude to improve your resume because if you are not, your competitor is sure going to use AI to enhance their resume.

## How to write skills?
I have gone through tens of thousands of CVs and while most people are more than qualified but they are rejected by ATS because their skills are not getting reflected to the algorithm ATS uses.  
  

Regarding the role you're pursuing - Thoroughly review the job posting at least **five** times, as the crucial insights lie embedded within it.

However, I understand that many individuals tend to overlook or skim through job descriptions. If you meticulously analyze what the job posting demands, crafting your resume will become considerably more straightforward.

If you encounter difficulty comprehending the job description, leverage AI resources like ChatGPT â€“ there's no shame in seeking assistance from such tools to ask for the primary skills required for the position.

Those adept at crafting effective prompts will be able to harness the full potential of AI language models like LLMs. Mastering the art of prompt engineering itself is a valuable skill. How you are writing to AI - this is also a skill which I have taught to many students.


## Remove Pictures
Eliminate any photographs, emblems, or visual elements, as they hold no bearing on showcasing your professional trajectory. I've witnessed individuals, particularly those belonging to the Gen-Z cohort, attempting to craft visually appealing resumes - your meticulously designed resume adorned with borders and embellishments serves no purpose if it fails to reach the recruiters' hands and is filtered out by the Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), which discard most CVs like this.

## Bullet Points

Within the sections detailing your professional experiences or internships, it is advisable to employ concise, bullet-pointed statements. By strategically incorporating appropriate action verbs, your resume will seamlessly navigate through the Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).
