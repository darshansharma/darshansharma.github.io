# Sapiens: A Journey Through Time

> What do you want to want?

What do you want to want?" This single question stayed with me as I turned the last page of [Sapiens](https://amzn.to/3PYzrLW). The book had been sitting on my shelf for a year, silently challenging me to dive into its depths. And dive I did, on the 25th of August this year.

# ðŸ“– My Reading Journey

Committing to a reading routine can be challenging. My pact with myself? A minimum of 25 pages every day. Some days, the storyline was so gripping that the book practically turned its own pages.By committing to this simple routine, I finished the book on 3rd October. I was so inspired that I immediately decided to share my experience in this blog.

# ðŸ§  The Impact of Sapiens on My Worldview

One aspect of "Sapiens" that truly resonated with me was its exploration of the cognitive revolution. How our ancestor's ability to create and believe in shared myths led to the birth of cultures, religions, and societal norms. It is a reminder of the power of stories in shaping our world. It prompted me to question - which myths are shaping my life today?


### ðŸš¨ Spoiler Alert! ðŸš¨

>The author navigates the intricate tapestry of human history, tracing our journey from 10,000 years ago to      
the cutting-edge realm of genetic engineering in 2014. Itâ€™s very similar to a roller coaster ride through the   
sands of time.     
    
>The author delves deep into the mighty empires that once shaped our world â€” from the magnificent empire of Rome,     
its influential leaders, to the imperial ambitions of the British Empire and Spainâ€™s relentless drive for foreign     
treasures. This book doesnâ€™t just recount historical events; it makes one reflect on the human spirit, our ambitions,       
and the lengths we go to realize our desires. 
              
>A captivating read from start to finish, this book offers a seamless blend of history, culture, and science.      
Highly recommended for those keen on understanding the past to decode our present.
