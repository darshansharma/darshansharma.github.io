## US MNC 7-Eleven branch of India is corrupted

Join me as we delve into the structural practices of a company named [7-Eleven Global Solution Center](https://www.linkedin.com/company/7-eleven-global-solution-center/), situated in Bhartiya City, Main Thanisandra Road, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560064.


Consider the case of Darshan Sharma (me) from Chandigarh, I was terminated within just 18 days of joining. How was such a quick judgment made? 


**I really do not know why they fired me?**

Maybe I was a bit rude in filing for reimbursments but that still does not make for firing an SDE II whom many people worked hard to hire. 

US MNC 7-Eleven - Maybe it is good company or maybe not but here in Indian branch of it the people in management are Indians and some people are bit immature for their position. Because such kind of firing does not take place under an effective and great leadership. 

The person who fired me - 
1. Wasted hours of work done by HRs and Hiring Manager during my hiring
2. I took an apartment here for which I have to pay 1 Lakh as deposit because I thought I will be getting reimbursment money which was promised to me in Offer Letter
but never received a single penny during my tenure. This money issue started to took
a toll on me and Indian Finance Management team was heavily scrutinizing all my reimbursment claims like Aeroplane ticket, calling relocator provider if I actually used their service or not. If you can't trust your employee then why did you hired me? 

For me, trust plays very important role. Trust building amongst the team-mates should be number one priority for any management or leader.

I looped in GeneralHRDept (which includes US HR dept also) and wrote to them about these things. Next Morning, I found my email and account de-activated, maybe someone was so afraid of this information going to US HR dept that they de-activated my account
and called me and told me to resign. I denied. Then they said we will pay you extra money still I denied. Then they fired me and told me maybe, this will end your carrer, I told them maybe you people bribe engineers but for me I will feel no shame in telling companies that I got fired and provided with "No Reason". Instead it puts a bad
light on you people. 

**Character of a person can not be bought by money**

  
## Promised Reimbursment but paid 0 Rs during my Tenure
The company provided hotel accommodations, but bill was paid by me because HRs had informed me on the first day that meal expenses, Hotel stay, AirFare (later in post you will come to know they never reimbursed me) would be reimbursed.

On the 19th day, Darshan approached the finance team to inquire about the delay in his meal reimbursements. However, when I started reading that rulebook I found out inconsistencies in it. Like HR telling me something else and I am entitled to something else. 

### Note: 

> **While I had 0 bank balance the VP of this company along with HR management was partying because they had just bought by bribing "Best Place to work 2024 certified" - Hypocrisy at its peak level.**

> **Instead of giving employees bonus VP spend lakhs to get "Best Place to work 2024 certified" - Here is the difference between a good leader and a great leader.**

> **A great leader thinks for his employees first, not for his own achievements because they knows that their success lies in their employees success**

When I highlighted the contradictions in the rulebooks to HR, I inadvertently put her on pins and needles. Fearing her own job was on the line if the issue blew up, she decided it was safer to push for my resignation. On the 19th day, she summoned him to a secluded room with 2 strangers. These 2 people urged me to resign, explaining that they were instructed to secure his resignation. Defiant, Darshan refused, challenging them to terminate him instead, because I knew what is going behind the scenes now.

The duo, visibly shaken, tried to coax him into resigning by offering him a financial incentive. I retorted sharply, suggesting they use the money to "buy cheap developers" instead. Asserting my integrity, I declared I’d rather face termination from a thousand companies than resign under such circumstances. Realizing she had no other option to protect her position, HR finally terminated me.

Next Day I wrote on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/linkedin/)  about how I was lured to Bengaluru by promising reimbursement of Hotel, Meals, transport, AirFare but the same company  [7-Eleven Global Solution Center](https://www.linkedin.com/company/7-eleven-global-solution-center/)  hasn’t paid single Rupee and fired instead.  
These people in India Mgmt team are involved in threatening also. These people threatened me on call 19 April 2024 because I wrote against them on LinkedIn.
  
I have total 5+ years of experience but before this company these things never happened with me. They even used KPMG to do my background verification which was more 
of a harrasment but still I passed in their background verification but one question remains unclear - 

> Why did they hired, just to fire me and hard work of a lot of people went in vain?
