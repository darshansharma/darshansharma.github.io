## US MNC 7-Eleven Branch of India is Corrupted

Join me as we delve into the structural practices of a company named [7-Eleven Global Solution Center](https://www.linkedin.com/company/7-eleven-global-solution-center/), situated in Bhartiya City, Main Thanisandra Road, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560064.


Consider the case of Darshan Sharma (me) from Chandigarh; I was terminated within just 18 days of joining. How was such a quick judgment made?


**I really do not know why they fired me.**

Perhaps I was a bit direct when filing for reimbursements, but that alone should not justify firing an SDE II, especially when many people worked hard to hire me.

US MNC 7-Eleven—maybe it is a good company, or maybe not. However, here in the Indian branch, the people in management are Indians, and some seem a bit immature for their positions. Such kind of firing does not take place under effective and great leadership. 

The person who fired me - 
1. Wasted hours of work done by HRs and Hiring Manager during my hiring
2. I took an apartment here for which I had to pay 1 lakh as a deposit because I thought I would be getting reimbursement money, which was promised to me in the offer letter, but I never received a single penny during my tenure. This money issue started to take a toll on me, and the Indian Finance Management team heavily scrutinized all my reimbursement claims, such as airplane tickets and calling the relocator provider to verify if I actually used their service. If you can't trust your employee, then why did you hire me? 
  
For me, trust plays a very important role. Building trust amongst teammates should be the number one priority for any management or leader.

I looped in GeneralHRDept (which includes the US HR dept also) and wrote to them about these things. The next morning, I found my email and account deactivated, maybe because someone was so afraid of this information going to the US HR dept that they deactivated my account and called me, telling me to resign. I denied. Then they said they would pay me extra money; still, I denied. Then they fired me and told me maybe this will end your career. I told them maybe you people bribe engineers, but for me, I will feel no shame in telling companies that I got fired and was provided with "No Reason." Instead, it puts a bad light on you people.

**Character of a person cannot be bought by money**

  
## Promised Reimbursement but Paid 0 Rs During My Tenure
The company provided hotel accommodations, but bill was paid by me because HRs had informed me on the first day that meal expenses, Hotel stay, AirFare (later in post you will come to know they never reimbursed me) would be reimbursed.

On the 19th day, I approached the finance team to inquire about the delay in my meal reimbursements. However, when I started reading the rulebook, I found out about inconsistencies in it, like HR telling me one thing and I am entitled to something else.

### Note: 

> **While I had 0 bank balance, the VP of this company along with HR management was partying because they had just bought by bribing "Best Place to work 2024 certified"—hypocrisy at its peak level.**

> **Instead of giving employees bonuses, the VP spent lakhs to get "Best Place to work 2024 certified." Here is the difference between a good leader and a great leader**

> **A great leader thinks for his employees first, not for his own achievements because they knows that their success lies in their employees success**

When I highlighted the contradictions in the rulebooks to HR, I inadvertently put her "on the spot." Fearing her own job was on the line if the issue blew up, she decided it was safer to push for my resignation. On the 19th day, she summoned me to a secluded room with two strangers. These two people urged me to resign, explaining that they were instructed to secure my resignation. Defiant, I refused, challenging them to terminate me instead, because I knew what was going behind the scenes.

The duo, visibly shaken, tried to coax me into resigning by offering me a financial incentive. I retorted sharply, suggesting they use the money to "buy cheap developers" instead. Asserting my integrity, I declared I’d rather face termination from a thousand companies than resign under such circumstances. Realizing she had no other option to protect her position, HR finally terminated me.

The next day, I wrote on LinkedIn about how I was lured to Bengaluru by promising reimbursement of hotel, meals, transport, and airfare but the same company, [7-Eleven Global Solution Center](https://www.linkedin.com/company/7-eleven-global-solution-center/), hasn’t paid a single rupee and fired me instead. These people in the India management team are also involved in threats. These people threatened me on a call on April 19, 2024, because I wrote against them on LinkedIn.
  
I have a total of 5+ years of experience, but before this company, these things never happened to me. They even used KPMG to do my background verification, which was more of harassment, but still, I passed their background verification, but one question remains unclear:  

> ## Why did they hire me, only to fire me, letting the hard work of many go to waste?
