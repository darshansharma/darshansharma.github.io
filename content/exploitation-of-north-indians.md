## Canadian MNC 7-Eleven spreading hate and discrimination in India

Join me as we delve into the structural practices of a company named [7-Eleven Global Solution Center](https://www.linkedin.com/company/7-eleven-global-solution-center/), situated in Bhartiya City, Main Thanisandra Road, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560064.

## Why 2 handbooks?
<br>
<br>

![enter image description here](https://dars-portfolio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Images/Why+2+GSC+HANDBOOK.jpg)
<br>
<br>

This organization categorizes its employees into two distinct groups:
1. North-Indian Engineer
2. South-Indian Engineer

This isn't a light-hearted matter—the company actually maintains two different employee handbooks under the label GSC (Global Solution Centre) Employee Handbook:
1. GSC Handbook 1 for individuals from Northern India
2. GSC Handbook 2 for locals or those from Karnataka and the Southern regions

These handbooks are contradictory; GSC-1 imposes stricter rules with fewer perks, while GSC-2 allows for unlimited reimbursements.

Operational dynamics are also quite distinct:
1. North-Indian Engineers report to a South Indian Manager Mubhdeep Sondal (name changed).
2. South-Indian Engineers are assigned managers based on their specific job functions.

Introducing another pivotal figure, the contentious HR—Phetna Charsar (name changed).

Mubhdeep and Phetna collaborate closely and have a systematic approach:
1. If Mubhdeep decides to sideline an engineer from the North, he withholds crucial product knowledge, affecting the engineer's performance.
2. Concurrently, Phetna intensifies her scrutiny, repeatedly summoning the engineer and documenting alleged misconduct.

Consider the case of Darshan Sharma (me) from Chandigarh, who was terminated within just 20 days of joining. How was such a quick judgment made? How can Mubhdeep exploited him because 20 days are very less to judge an engineer from the North-India? So it turned out Mubhdeep had never gave a KT session to transfer knowledge about product to Darshan but still 20 days are very less how then he got fired? Phetna ( the evil HR ) started involving Darshan in emails and delayed his reimbursement which for a typical engineer don’t take much Darshan was not given access to Software / hell he even did not know that you have to take access (maybe rule for north indians) so Phetna didn’t give access to software, 14 days have passed and on the eve of new year (Karnataka New Year, Gudi Padwa) Darshan requested access to software in email and somehow (by coincidence) trust me really coincident Darshan typed Ge and Outlook autofilled for him [GeneralHRManagment@7-11.com](mailto:GeneralHRManagment@7-11.com) and asks for access of that software.

## Darshan under intense examination
Despite it being a holiday, both Mubhdeep and Phetna contacted Darshan, questioning his actions.
When confronted by Phetna about how he accessed an email for the US and Canada HR department, Darshan explained the Outlook autofill mishap, but his explanation was met with skepticism due to my Northern heritage.

From this point, the strategies to push him toward resignation began. 
 
## Why Mubhdeep want Darshan out? 
To know the reality let’s go back to Day 1 when - demo day - Mubhdeep was absent as on 25th March it was Holi but some people were there who made Darshan feel like home (as he has travelled miles away from his home first time for job). Now Phetna tells her teammate to tell Darshan he can go to hotel (accommodation provided by company but bill paid by Darshan) so Darshan was returning to his hotel when he received a phone call informing him that Mubhdeep wished to speak with him. Darshan responded that he was en route to the hotel and Mubhdeep could either speak with him the next day or once he arrived at the hotel. From that moment on, despite Darshan's helpful demeanor, Mubhdeep also wanted him gone.
  
  
So now you know why Mubhdeep didn’t gave any KT session to Darshan but gave to an engineer (it feels very bad when i write south/north) but I had to write it Mubhdeep gave KT to a south-Indian Engineer (junior than Darshan) and also to people who joined after him.  
  
## Promised Reimbursment but paid 0 Rs during my Tenure
The company provided hotel accommodations, but bill was paid by me because Phetna had informed me on the first day that meal expenses, Hotel stay, AirFare (later in post you will come to know they never reimbursed me because I am North-Indian) would be reimbursed. [Click Here to read Offer Letter](https://dars-portfolio.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/PDF/Offer+Letter.pdf)

Now lets go back to the email incident when (Joining + 14 days) the next day Darshan got access to cab, software where he can file for reimbursement as Darshan is not an entrepreneur his pocket was draining fast. So he immediately files access for Airfare, Hotel Stay, Hotel meal expenses on the software where reimbursement is filed - Mubhdeep approved that by verifying receipt but evil Phetna had something else in mind she stops the Finance team from reimbursing Darshan and finally on day 17 - Darshan had to took loan from  [CRED](https://www.linkedin.com/company/credapp/)  app of 5 lakhs rupees. Innocent Darshan never knew that he was never going to reimbursed a single penny because  
1. He is North-Indian  
2. Mubhdeep and Phetna both want him out 
  
On the 19th day, Darshan approached the finance team to inquire about the delay in his meal reimbursements. He was informed that the maximum claimable amount for hotel meals under the GSC-1 rulebook was Rs 1000. However, the finance team mistakenly showed him an image from GSC-1 while attaching GSC-2 (the rulebook for South Indians) to the email. Darshan then requested a reimbursement of Rs 1000 per day, noting that if he stayed in the hotel for 9 days, the total would amount to Rs 9000 (1000 * 9). He confirmed this calculation in an email.

Subsequently, Darshan began reading GSC-2, which was not intended for him but was mistakenly attached to the email by the finance team. There, he discovered that for the relocation of goods, an employee must choose their own relocation service. Realizing this, he informed his manager Mubhdeep, as any reasonable person would, especially since Phetna had previously informed him that he was not eligible for reimbursement. as he used third party vendor (violation in GSC - 1)  

> Note: **While Darshan had 0 bank balance the VP of this company along with Phetna was partying because She had just bought by bribing "Best Place to work 2024 certified" - Hypocrisy at its peak level.**
> **Instead of giving employees bonus VP spend lakhs to get "Best Place to work 2024 certified" - Here is the difference between a good leader and a great leader.**
> **A great leader thinks for his employees first, not for his own achievements because they knows that their success lies in their employees success**

When Darshan highlighted the contradictions in the rulebooks to Phetna, he inadvertently put her on pins and needles. Fearing her own job was on the line if the issue blew up, she decided it was safer to push for Darshan's resignation. On the 20th day, she summoned him to a secluded room with two strangers (Phetna lacked the courage to sit face-to-face with Darshan.). These 2 people urged Darshan to resign, explaining that they were instructed to secure his resignation. Defiant, Darshan refused, challenging them to terminate him instead, because Darshan knew what is going behind the scenes now.

The duo, visibly shaken, tried to coax him into resigning by offering him a financial incentive. Darshan retorted sharply, suggesting they use the money to "buy cartoon developers whom they can exploit later" instead. Asserting his integrity, he declared he’d rather face termination from a thousand companies than resign under such circumstances. Realizing she had no other option to protect her position, Phetna finally terminated him.

Next Day Darshan writes on  [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/linkedin/)  about how he was lured to Bengaluru by promising reimbursement of Hotel, Meals, transport, AirFare but the same company  [7-Eleven Global Solution Center](https://www.linkedin.com/company/7-eleven-global-solution-center/)  hasn’t paid single Rupee and fired him.  
[7-Eleven](https://www.linkedin.com/company/7-eleven/)  and these are involved in threatening also. These people threatened Darshan on call 19 April 2024.  
  
While writing these 3 posts it was very difficult and painful at the same time to classify Indians as South-Indian or North-Indian but I think this is the philosophy of  [7-Eleven Canada](https://www.linkedin.com/company/7-eleven-canada-inc./)  to divide Indians by creating hatred amongst them.  
I have total 5+ years of experience but before this company I never even used the word North Indian or South Indian.
