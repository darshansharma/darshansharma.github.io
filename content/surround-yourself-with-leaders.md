### From Underdogs to Champions: The Power of the Right Influence

Xabi Alonso has taken Bayern Leverkusen from 17th place to the top of the table with an impressive 49 matches undefeated, setting new records. Similarly, Bielsa led Leeds United to enter the Premier League after a 16-year gap in 2021, they even defeated the almighty oil team of Manchester City.

Consider Elon Musk. When he fires employees, his companies continue to thrive, but when others follow same, they often fail. Musk has a unique trait of influencing people and transforming underdogs into lions.

**Observation:** It’s not that you are incapable; it’s that you haven’t found the right teacher yet.

### Who Surrounds You Matters 

Who are you surrounding yourself with? Who inspires you? Ensure you are surrounded by lions; this choice is within your control.

>> “Jimhe amogh chale raghu bana, ahee bhaati chale Hanumana”

  



Hanuman, the most powerful warrior in Shri Ram’s army, didn't realize his potential until he met Ram and Jambavan. Once reminded of his inner strength, his power and wisdom became boundless. When he leaped towards Lanka, the mountain he sprang from was pushed deep into the river surrounding it. This immense power was awakened by the right influence.

Leaders are not born; they are created through discipline and strong character, transforming a sheep into a lion. Just as one lit candle can ignite others, a strong influence can awaken the potential within you (Buddha).

Surround yourself with people who elevate you. The impact of your surroundings on your future is profound.
