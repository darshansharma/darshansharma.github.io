After relocating to Noida for work from Chandigarh, I've noticed some stark contrasts. Here's my take on how the Tricity differs from the NCR, based on my six-month stint:  
  
1. 𝐀𝐝𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐟𝐟𝐢𝐜 𝐑𝐮𝐥𝐞𝐬: In the Tricity, traffic regulations are followed to the letter, especially in Chandigarh. Violations like helmet-less driving, wrong-way navigation, or red light breaches result in immediate penalties, regardless of police presence. Every traffic signal boasts high-security CCTV surveillance. Conversely, in the NCR, it's a different ball game. People flout traffic lights, and riding without a helmet often goes unchecked by the authorities. Ironically, wearing a helmet seems to invite more scrutiny, deviating from the local norm😂.  
  
2. 𝐆𝐮𝐧 𝐂𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐋𝐨𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐧𝐬: Contrary to our initial beliefs, the Tricity, particularly Chandigarh, is a haven of safety. Women can roam freely, even at odd hours like 1AM, thanks to the vigilant Chandigarh Police. In the NCR, however, the scenario is night and day. The presence of guns in vehicles is alarming, and minor car scuffles can escalate quickly. It's wise to avoid confrontations, as you never know who's armed. The Tricity emerges as a sanctuary in comparison. The rampant corruption among officials in the NCR only adds to the grim picture.  
  
3. 𝐏𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐋𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥𝐬: The Tricity wins hands down in terms of air quality. The NCR's pollution woes are exacerbated not by its residents but by neighboring farmers in Haryana who burn crop residue. If only these farmers were educated about alternative uses of this 'parali', like power generation by innovative startups, the situation could improve.  
  
4. 𝐋𝐨𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐃𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐚𝐧𝐨𝐫: The overall temperament of people in the Tricity is more commendable than in the NCR. This is a broad generalization, though. The NCR does have its share of kind-hearted souls. However, a significant portion, especially from Delhi, are educated yet lack basic civic sense.  

The smoggy skies and busy roads serve as a constant reminder of the environmental and health challenges that lie at the heart of urban living. This aspect of life in the NCR highlights the urgent need for sustainable practices and conscious living, something that residents and authorities alike grapple with. As one settles into the rhythm of the NCR, these elements coalesce, painting a vivid picture of life in one of India's most dynamic regions, a mosaic of challenges. And where there are challenges, there are always solutions lying nearby to solve those challenges. We just need change the lense by which we are looking at them.
  
I hope this post may help someone in future who is moving from Tricity to NCR for the very first time.
