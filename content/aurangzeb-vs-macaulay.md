In this post, I aim to shed light on an issue that has been in my mind since last few days. It concerns the recognition, or rather the lack of it, accorded to the incredible philosophers hailing from the Indian subcontinent.
<br>
At the heart of my discourse lies Kabir Das, a man I personally consider as one of the world's most profound philosophers. Despite his invaluable contributions to philosophical and spiritual thought, his recognition pales when compared to Western philosophers like Freud, Marx, Kant, and Hume. The question that arises is - why?

# Hailing from India
Kabir Das hailed from India, a land renowned for producing an array of saints and philosophers. Unfortunately, the recognition these saints or philosphers deserve on a global scale has often remained elusive.
<br>
Let's take the case of Ramanujan, whose story had a happier outcome. But even he had to face trials and tribulations before his genius was recognized. How many more 'Ramanujans' were there in India at that time, their potential got untapped, their brilliance got unnoticed at that time because Lord Macaulay had already changed the India education system so that Britishers don't face much difficulty in ruling over India. 
<br>
Till date our education system is not changed. They needed labourers especially those who don't ask questions and India is still producing it.

# Who did more harm to India - Aurangzeb or Lord Macaulay? 
One wiped the sanskrit shlokas which used to give siddhis to its reader just by reading the shlokas written in books in the universities. wiped out the whole spirtual text.
Other wiped out the scientific knowledge and put down a barrier for people with minds like Ramnujan stay illitreate. Just imagine this guy has not only harmed India but the whole world because we don't know how far science and technology would have reached today only if he had not stopped the poor children of India belonging from plethora of villages.

No doubt, history is immutable, and lamenting over the past serves little purpose. However, recognizing the missteps and understanding their implications is crucial. It helps us to reflect, reconsider, and hopefully, reshape our future, ensuring that deserving talents do not go unnoticed anymore.
