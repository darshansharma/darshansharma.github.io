We 3 friends decided on a Friday night to visit Morni Hills and Tikkar Taal on next morning. Since it was summer season so that's why we decided to leave at 5AM.
I am wondering where do I start from? Let's see. Let's start from the very start. We met at the toll plaza at 5:30 AM and we were 3 friends. We then took the first left near to the toll plaza (when coming towards Panchkula from Pinjore).

Then we went straight. First sight was of Ghaggar river which was on our left side. We moved on and as the road became more and more incline the fun and excitement was increasing at the same speed amongst all 3 of us. As we moved further on the view from above was so captivating that we took a short break and clicked some pictures of ourselves. 

> The road which leads to destination is filled with more compassion than the destination itself and we enjoyed every part of it.

We then stopped at a cafe to have some breakfast. 

> Whatever place you are travelling to, friends make it more fun. 

After reaching Tikkar Taal we stopped at a cafe and had a cold coffee. As we were the first of all tourist to arrive on that day we had a lot of time to chit-chat in the midst of a river and a hill (Tikkar Taal). After one and half hour other people started coming in too and made the place more sight-full and attractive. After some time we left for an adventure park which I think is 200m past the Tikkar Taal and it the ticket price for that park was 50 INR per person and we 3 enjoyed more in that park than Tikkar Taal. It was full of fun activities (kind of like a trek). After spending 2 hours there we left for our home and on our way we took a bath in Ghaggar river too.
It took half a day for all that fun and it was more than worth it. If you are someone who lives in tricity then I recommend to visit it once, you will have fun and it will not take too much of your time too.

Now, I suppose it's time I should put down my pen.
